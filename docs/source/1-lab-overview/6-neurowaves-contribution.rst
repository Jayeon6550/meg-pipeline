Contributing
------------

After building an initial draft of your experiment code and you wish to start testing it, collect all the files relative to your experiment into one directory, name your directory as the name of your experiment.
The contribution will be submitted for review through github. If you already have a github account sign in to it, if not create a github account.

- Fork the current repository to your account
- On the created fork, create a new branch named with the feature you are developping or change you are making
- Add the directory containing the files of your experiment under the `experiments/psychopy` or `experiments/psychtoolbox` according to which framework you are using.
- Create a pull request from your branch to the main branch of the source repository (Not your fork, but the original repo)
- Add any comments you want the reviewer to know of
- A reviewer will review your code and either approve or ask for changes
- If changes are needed, make the changes and push your new code to the same branch, your PR (Pull Request) will then get automatically updated
- Consider adding a page describing your experiment to the `docs\source\3-experimentdesign\experiments`
- Once your branch is merged to the main branch (meaning your experiment is approved), your code will be available in the MEG lab Stimulus computer

Building your processing pipeline
=================================

Do the same steps as before to fork the repository and create a new branch named as `experiment_name-analysis`
Submit an initial notebook under `docs/source/5-pipeline/notebooks` or simply code file for your pipeline under `pipeline\experiment_name`



Contributing to this repository Overview
========================================

Your contribution, mistake correction, code contributions are very welcome.
Contributions are made through pull reqests, please do the following steps:

To add a toctree with the content of your page, copy the following code at the beginning of your page contents::

   .. contents::
      :local:
      :depth: 2

This will render as:

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 2

Making a Checklist
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


You can add simple task checklists to any page using the ``checklist`` directive.

.. note::
   Checklists are **clickable in HTML builds**. In PDF/LaTeX they render as
   static boxes (``□`` / ``☒``). If your project includes the optional
   ``checklist.js``, checkbox state is remembered per browser.

Prerequisites
"""""""""""""

- The custom extension is enabled in ``conf.py`` (for example)::

    extensions = [
        # ... other extensions ...
        'checklist',   # or '_checklist' if that’s your package name
    ]

Basic usage
"""""""""""

Write one task per line inside the directive. Use ``[ ]`` for unchecked and
``[x]`` for checked.

.. code-block:: rst

   .. checklist::

      - [ ] Write the introduction
      - [x] Add figures
      - [ ] Final proofreading

Result (HTML)
""-------------""

- ☐ Write the introduction
- ☑ Add figures
- ☐ Final proofreading

Tips
----

- Start each task with ``- [ ]`` or ``- [x]`` exactly (lowercase ``x``).
- Each task is **plain text** (no nested markup).
- For sub-tasks, add another checklist block under a bullet or subsection.

Example with sections
---------------------

.. code-block:: rst

   Project TODOs
   --------------

   **Docs**

   .. checklist::

      - [ ] API reference pass
      - [x] Tutorial outline

   **Release**

   .. checklist::

      - [ ] Changelog
      - [ ] Tag and publish


Setting up MATLAB Kernel for Jupyter
====================================

To run MATLAB code within Jupyter Notebooks, you need to set up the MATLAB kernel in your environment.

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Ensure you have **MATLAB R2025b** installed (required for Python 3.12+ compatibility).
- Your conda environment should be using **Python 3.12**.

Installation Steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. **Activate your environment**:
   
   .. code-block:: bash

      conda activate neurowaves-lab-documentation

2. **Install Jupyter and the MATLAB Kernel**:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda install notebook jupyter_client
      pip install matlab_kernel

3. **Install the MATLAB Engine for Python**:
   Navigate to your MATLAB installation folder (e.g., ``C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2025b\extern\engines\python``) and install the engine:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd "C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2025b\extern\engines\python"
      python -m pip install .

Using the Kernels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Two kernels will be available in Jupyter:

- **Matlab**: Starts a new, independent MATLAB session for the notebook.
- **Matlab (Connection)**: Connects to an already running MATLAB instance, allowing you to share the workspace.

To use the **Connection** kernel:

1. In your standalone MATLAB Command Window, run:

   .. code-block:: matlab

      matlab.engine.shareEngine

2. In Jupyter, select the **Matlab (Connection)** kernel. You can now access variables from your standalone MATLAB session using commands like ``who`` or simply typing the variable name.

Thank you for your contribution!





Calendar Synchronisation Technical Setup
========================================

The MEG Lab uses a synchronization workflow to mirror bookings from the Corelabs (Booked) portal to a Google Calendar. This allows researchers to use Google Calendar features like "Appointment Schedules" to manage participant bookings while automatically respecting the lab's availability.

Infrastructure Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The synchronization consists of three main components:

1. **Python Script**: :github-file:`scripts/sync-gcal.py` fetches the lab's ICS feed, parses events, and upserts them into Google Calendar via the Google Calendar API.
2. **Google Cloud Project**: A service account with "Editor" access to the specific Lab Google Calendar.
3. **GitHub Actions**: A workflow :github-file:`.github/workflows/sync-gcal.yml` that runs every 5 minutes on a self-hosted Windows workstation.

Google Cloud Platform Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To maintain or update the synchronization, you need access to the Google Cloud Project:

1. **Service Account**: Create a service account in the GCP Console.
2. **API Key**: Generate a JSON key for the service account and store it securely.
3. **Calendar Access**: Share the target Google Calendar with the service account's email (found in the JSON key) with **Make changes to events** permissions.

GitHub Repository Secrets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following secrets must be configured in the GitHub repository (Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions):

* ``GOOGLE_SA_JSON``: The entire content of the service account JSON key file.
* ``GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID``: The ID of the target Google Calendar.
* ``BOOKED_ICS_URL``: The private iCal subscription URL from Corelabs.
* ``LOCAL_CONDA_PATH``: (Optional) Path to the ``conda`` executable on the self-hosted runner.
* ``LOCAL_CONDA_ENV_PATH``: (Optional) Path to the conda environment to use (e.g., ``C:\Users\hz3752\anaconda3\envs\neurowaves-lab-documentation``).

Self-Hosted Runner Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The workflow is designed to run on a **Windows** runner (specifically the MEG workstation) to avoid dependencies on cloud-hosted runners and to leverage local environments.

**Windows-specific tips:**
- The workflow uses ``pwsh`` (PowerShell Core) for robust command execution.
- Environmental variables like ``CONDA_EXE`` and ``CONDA_ENV_PATH`` are used to invoke the correct Python environment without requiring a full ``conda init`` in every run, which prevents path recursion limits.
- The service account JSON is dynamically created on the runner during each run using the ``GOOGLE_SA_JSON`` secret and deleted afterward.
